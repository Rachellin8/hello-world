# hello-world
### Starting project on GitHub


I am a noob to both coding and GitHub. Any tips or advice are taken as constructive and are much appreciated!

My pastimes include: 
- studying cybersec,
- anything outdoors,
- tending dogs (including my own border collie / Australian kelpie mix),
- music:
    I am a half-a**ed ukulele, piano, mando, and fiddle player.

Thanks for following along on my experience!
